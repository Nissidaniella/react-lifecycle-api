Here is a suggested README file for the React users component examples:

# React Users Components

This project contains examples of components to fetch and display a list of users using function and class components in React.

## Features

- Function component with hooks
- Class component with lifecycle methods
- Fetching data from JSON placeholder API
- Mapping over data to display user details

## Components

- UsersFunction.jsx
  - Function component using useState and useEffect hooks
- UsersClass.jsx
  - Class component with componentDidMount lifecycle method

## Data Fetching 

The components use:

- Axios in function component
- Fetch API in class component 

to make requests and retrieve user data.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run:

```
npm install
```

To view each component:

```
npm start
```

## Differences 

The key differences between function and class components are demonstrated, specifically:

- Hooks vs lifecycle methods
- State handling with useState vs this.state

This provides a basic example of fetching data in both types of components.
